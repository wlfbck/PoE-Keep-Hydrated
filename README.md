# A simple Java tool for pricechecking Path of Exile items

I mainly made this as an exercise for myself, but thought it might be useful for some people. It uses poe.ninjas price data (updated on startup and every two hours after). Currently works for all Uniques (including maps) and Divination Cards.

## How to use

If you have Java installed, just run the jar and press F3 when hovering over an item. That's it!
