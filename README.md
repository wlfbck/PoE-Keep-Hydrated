# A simple Java tool for automatically pressing 2 to 5 (thus drinking the potions there in Path of Exile).

I mainly made this as an exercise for myself, but thought it might be useful for some people. 

## How to use

If you have Java installed, just run the jar and press F. That's it! You can toggle it off/on by pressing circumflex (^).
